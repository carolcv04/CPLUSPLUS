** What happens if you enter a string or
a double instead of an integer: **

- If you enter a char or a string the result
for the sum & difference will be the 
constant number. As for product & quotient, 
the result will be 0. 

- If you enter a double, it will only utilize
the first number ex. if you enter 1.7, 
it will utilize 1 for the calculations.
